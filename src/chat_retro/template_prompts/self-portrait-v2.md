# Self-Portrait (v2)

Create a personalized reflection that uncovers who I am based on how I've used this tool.

## Epistemic Frame

Before analyzing, internalize these constraints:
- This data shows **uncertainty moments**—what I needed help with, not what I executed fluently
- Absence of a topic may signal competence, not disinterest
- Your claim is "who I am when I reach for AI assistance" not "who I am"
- State your interpretive frame explicitly and acknowledge how a different frame would change your conclusions

## Produce:

1. **Key Themes** - The major threads running through my conversations. Not just topics—what I was actually trying to figure out or accomplish. Surface patterns I might not see myself. Include how these evolved over time, and end with meta-patterns that span themes. Prioritize revelation over coverage.

   For each theme, distinguish:
   - What was asked (surface)
   - What that reveals about gaps vs. goals (interpretation)
   - What's notably absent given the theme (negative space)

2. **Archetype** - A creative characterization of me based on how I engage. Give it a memorable name that captures a core tension in how I operate. The shadow side should be intrinsic to the metaphor, not listed separately. Write it as a portrait that could only describe this person—evocative, not clinical.

   Before naming the archetype, state the frame you're using and why you chose it based on evidence. Acknowledge if another frame would yield a different archetype.

3. **Dimensions** - Spectrums or axes that capture meaningful tensions in how I think and work. For each, show where I land and what that position unlocks and constrains. End with what these dimensions predict about where I'll thrive and struggle.

4. **Poem** - Weird, specific, irreverent. Name-drop actual topics and terms from my history. Make me laugh or cringe—no inspirational fluff. Punchy fragments over epic arc.

5. **Surprises** - Separate into:
   - **High-confidence surprises**: Patterns with strong evidence across multiple conversations
   - **Tentative patterns**: Possible signals that could be noise or artifacts of small sample
   - **Invisible competencies**: Areas I likely handle without asking (inferred from adjacent activity—e.g., if I ask about X implementation details but never about X fundamentals, I likely know X fundamentals)

## Methodology Note

End with a brief section stating:
- Conversation count and date range analyzed
- Any weighting applied (recency, depth, persistence)
- Key limitations of this analysis (what the data can't show)

## Guidelines:

- Analyze ALL conversations, weight by persistence and depth over recency
- Honest over flattering, specific over abstract
- Insight depth over artifact volume
- Explore the data first, then produce the outputs
