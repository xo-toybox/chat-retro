# Self-Portrait

Create a personalized reflection that uncovers who I am based on how I've used this tool.

## Produce:

1. **Key Themes** - The major threads running through my conversations. Not just topics—what I was actually trying to figure out or accomplish. Surface patterns I might not see myself. Include how these evolved over time, and end with meta-patterns that span themes. Prioritize revelation over coverage.

2. **Archetype** - A creative characterization of me based on how I engage. Give it a memorable name that captures a core tension in how I operate. The shadow side should be intrinsic to the metaphor, not listed separately. Write it as a portrait that could only describe this person—evocative, not clinical.

3. **Dimensions** - Spectrums or axes that capture meaningful tensions in how I think and work. For each, show where I land and what that position unlocks and constrains. End with what these dimensions predict about where I'll thrive and struggle.

4. **Poem** - Weird, specific, irreverent. Name-drop actual topics and terms from my history. Make me laugh or cringe—no inspirational fluff. Punchy fragments over epic arc.

5. **Surprises** - Things that might not be obvious to me: hidden patterns, unexpected absences, contradictions between signals, sharp changes over time. Focus on what's genuinely surprising, not just notable. Include what's missing that you'd expect to find.

## Guidelines:

- Analyze ALL conversations, weight by persistence and depth over recency
- Honest over flattering, specific over abstract
- Insight depth over artifact volume
- Explore the data first, then produce the outputs
